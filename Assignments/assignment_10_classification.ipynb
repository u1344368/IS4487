        "## Business Case: AdviseInvest\n",
        "You work on a small team of data analysts at AdviseInvest, a venture-backed startup. The Director of Sales at AdviseInvest has approached your team asking for help solving a staffing problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Company\n",
        "The company's mission is to provide tools and support to help ordinary people gain control of their personal finances. The company leverages technology to provide affordable financial advice to a national client base.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customers who reach AdviseInvest's website go through five steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Open an account.\n",
        "- Complete a customer profile form with basic information about their background and finances.\n",
        "- Schedule a free phone conversation with a sales representative during a 1-hour window of time.\n",
        "- Attend the free phone conversation.\n",
        "- Buy a financial plan.\n",
        "- There are three types of financial plans: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each is sold at a different price, and there are varying degrees of personalization. After a customer purchases a financial plan, the customer is assigned a financial planner who helps determine the customer's goals and advises the customer on spending decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Problem\n",
        "Some customers are lost at each stage of the process. Steps 3 and 4 are particularly challenging because approximately 50% of those who schedule a phone conversation fail to pick up the call. This leads to inefficiencies from a staffing perspective.\n",
        "\n",
        "AdviseInvest has 4 sales reps on staff during each particular 1-hour window. Each of the 4 reps is assigned 2 prospective customers per hour, which means that the company schedules a total of 8 phone calls per hour. The calls are outgoing: sales reps call customers who scheduled a phone conversation during that hour window.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, as noted above, many of the customers who scheduled a call do not answer. As a consequence, sales reps are often left underutilized. Moreover, they are underutilized unevenly. For example, it is possible that one sales rep will not do any sales calls during that hour, whereas another will be busy the entire hour with two calls. Sales reps have nothing to do when customers do not answer the scheduled phone call.\n",
